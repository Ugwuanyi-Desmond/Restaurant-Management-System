# Restaurant-Management-System
This Project is a Java Swing Restaurant Management System.
The system is used to calculate the total amount of every commodity purchased in a restaurant.
8 different products are available in the restaurant with their respective prices.
The number of each distinct product purchased can be entered into the system.
The system which already has embedded codes of the prices of the selected products, would then multiply the number of a particular product purchased, by the price.
The system can now calclate the total amount of goods purchased and display it.
Java inheritance method was used in this project
